    - Allow "@*" => [ "string()" => \&foo ] rules to work.
    - Allow "end::foo" rules to work
    - Add tracing support to xstack directives.
    - The xstack is now unwound after every non-start_ event.

    - Fix attribute ordering sensitivity on perl's hash algorithm.  This
      gets the test suite to pass and might help somebody somewhere's
      production code to operate in a predictable fashion across perl
      versions.
    - string( * ) now compiles (and works :)
    - get xstack synced with the order events.
    - add t/builder.t

0.4 Thu Dec 12 06:32:24 EST 2002
    - Major rewrite.  Now supports most of XPath plus EventPath goodies.
