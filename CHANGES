CHANGES file for XML::Filter::Dispatcher

0.41 Fri Dec 20 09:54:02 EST 2002
    - Fix attribute ordering sensitivity on perl's hash algorithm.  This
      gets the test suite to pass and might help somebody somewhere's
      production code to operate in a predictable fashion across perl
      versions.
    - string( * ) now compiles (and works :)
    - get XStack synced with the order events.
    - add t/builder.t

0.4 Thu Dec 12 06:32:24 EST 2002
    - Major rewrite.  Now supports most of XPath plus EventPath goodies.
